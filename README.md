#### The Knight's Tour is the challenge of finding a sequence of moves for a knight on a chessboard to visit every square exactly once. Using backtracking, I tackled this challenge by generating possible moves, picking one, and exploring until I found a complete tour or hit a dead end, then backtracking and trying again.
